# Smart Grocery Planner

**Smart Grocery Planner** is a web app designed to simplify your grocery shopping by generating a personalized shopping list based on your budget, dietary preferences, allergies, and meal planning needs.

## Features

- **Set your budget** to control your spending.  
- Choose your **dietary preference** (e.g., high protein, vegan, vegetarian, low carb).  
- Add any **allergies** to avoid unwanted ingredients.  
- Specify the number of **people**, **days**, and **meals per day** for accurate meal planning.  
- The app generates a **smart grocery list** tailored to your inputs.  
- Users can **save their lists** (with login) to revisit them later, showing the date saved and number of items.

## How it Works

1. The user inputs their budget, diet type, allergies, and meal plan details.

2. The app creates a smart grocery list tailored to the user‚Äôs preferences. (Note: The full shopping list is too long to display all images here.)

  </div>


3. Logged-in users can save their lists and view them later on the dashboard, showing relevant details.
